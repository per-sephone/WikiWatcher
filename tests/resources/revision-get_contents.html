It is also a common <a href="/wiki/Recreation" title="Recreation">recreation</a> and popular <a href="/wiki/Sport" title="Sport">sport</a>.r</p><p>Typical speeds for bicycles are 10-15 mph or 15-25 km/h. On a fast racing bicycle, a reasonably fit rider can ride at 30 mph or 50 km/h on the flat for short periods.  The highest speed ever attained on the flat, without riding behind a wind-block, is by Canadian <a href="/wiki/Sam_Whittingham" title="Sam Whittingham">Sam Whittingham</a>, who in 2001 set a 80.55 mph or 142.51 km/h record on his highly aerodynamic <a href="/wiki/Recumbent_bicycle" title="Recumbent bicycle">recumbent bicycle</a>.

The <a href="/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">German</a> <a href="/w/index.php?title=Baron_Karl_Drais_von_Sauerbronn&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Baron Karl Drais von Sauerbronn (page does not exist)">Baron Karl Drais von Sauerbronn</a> also has a claim with a "<b>Laufmaschine</b>" or "running machine", which he exhibited in <a href="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a> in <a href="/wiki/1818" title="1818">1818</a>. r</p><p>The first successful machines that resembled bicycles were invented in the early <a href="/wiki/1800s" class="mw-disambig" title="1800s">1800s</a>. The "<b>draisine</b>" of <a href="/wiki/1817" title="1817">1817</a> had two inline wheels connected to a wooden frame by forks, and the front wheel was steerable. It became rather popular, especially in <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a> and America. r</p><p>The draisine and machines like it went by a variety of names, such as  hobby horse, dandy horse, biciped or swift walker. They were more like <a href="/wiki/Scooter" class="mw-disambig" title="Scooter">scooters</a> than bicycles, because the only means of propulsion was to push against the ground. r</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/1840" title="1840">1840</a> the <a href="/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scottish</a> blacksmith <a href="/wiki/Kirkpatrick_McMillan" class="mw-redirect" title="Kirkpatrick McMillan">Kirkpatrick McMillan</a> designed and built the first rear-drive bicycle with pedals and cranks, and can therefore be credited as the inventor of the modern bicycle. MacMillan called his machine a "<b>velocipede</b>", and rode it the 40 miles from his home to <a href="/wiki/Glasgow" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>. On his approach to the city, crowds gathered on the road and unfortunately Kirkpatrick collided with a young girl. Altough she was only very slightly injured, he was subsequently charged with causing the first ever <a href="/wiki/Bicycle_accident" class="mw-redirect" title="Bicycle accident">bicycle accident</a>. The judge could not believe Kirkpatrick had travelled the 40 miles to Glasgow in only 5 hours, but after much explaining, he was allowed to return home.  Kirkpatrick McMillan never patented his designs, and his key role in the development of the modern bicycle has been largely unrecognised.   r</p><p>Machines similar to the "velocipede" became very popular after 1866, which is when Pierre Lallement obtained a US patent for a machine he called the "bisicle". Others called it a "boneshaker", an appropriate name for a contraption with steel-rimmed wooden wheels.r</p><p>Solid rubber tires appeared in 1869 and improved the ride somewhat. The front wheel got bigger, and the rear wheel got smaller. A bicycle boom began. The first highwheeler or 'Ordinary' appeared in 1872. This was called a "Penny Farthing" in England (a penny representing the front wheel, and a much smaller coin, the farthing, representing the rear wheel).r</p><p>Since a large wheel went farther for each turn of the cranks, and since the maximum pedalling speed was limited, the larger the wheel, the faster a rider could go. Some of the highwheelers had wheels nearly 60" in diameter. They were fast. They weren't particularly safe. The rider was way up in the air and travelling at a great speed. If he hit a bad spot in the road he could easily be thrown over the front wheel and be seriously injured or even killed. "Taking a header", which was not all that uncommon, was no joking matter. r</p><p>In 1884, <a href="/wiki/J._K._Starley" class="mw-redirect" title="J. K. Starley">J. K. Starley</a> of the Coventry Sewing Machine Company, invented the "<b>safety bicycle</b>" with wheels of moderate size and a chain drive. With the rider sitting far back on the bicycle, it was almost impossible to take a header on such a machine. With the front chainwheel larger than the rear sprocket, the rear wheel turned faster than the cranks, making it possible for a chain-driven bicycle to go fast even without a huge wheel.  r</p><p><a href="/wiki/John_Boyd_Dunlop" title="John Boyd Dunlop">John Boyd Dunlop</a> invented the pneumatic tyre in 1888. This made for a much smoother ride.  r</p><p>The safety bicycles of 1890 were very much like today's bicycles. They had pneumatic tyres similar in size to those on a modern bicycle, spoked wheels, a steel frame and a chain drive. About all they didn't have was a method of changing the gears.r</p><p>Multi-ratio gearing systems were present in racing bicycles by the 1930's, and <a href="/wiki/Derailleur" title="Derailleur">derailleur</a> systems evolved in the 1950's.r</p><h2><span id="Social_.26_Historical_aspect"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_&amp;_Historical_aspect">Social &amp; Historical aspect</span></h2><p>Socially, the bicycle helped to strengthen the gene pool for rural workers. It tripled their courting radius on the one day per week they had off and thus was a factor in reducing rural inbreeding. The two-wheeled, diamond-frame safety bicycle (basically the same one we ride today) gave women unprecedented mobility, freed them from corsets, and contributed to their <a href="/wiki/Emancipation" title="Emancipation">emancipation</a>.r</p><p>In cities, bicycles helped reduce the crowding in inner-city tenements by allowing workers to commute from single-family dwellings in suburbs. They helped reduce people's dependence on horses. They allowed people to travel in the country. They were three times as efficient as walking and three to four times as fast. Moreover, in terms of distance and speed travelled compared to energy consumed, the bicycle is the most efficient machine yet created.r</p><p>On an historical note, the development of the modern bicycle had two important implications. First, manufacture of the double-diamond-frame safety bicycle required the development of advanced metalworking techniques to produce the frames, and components such as <a href="/wiki/Ball-bearing" class="mw-redirect" title="Ball-bearing">ball-bearings</a>, washers and sprockets. These techniques later enabled skilled metalworkers and mechanics to develop the components that were used in early <a href="/wiki/Automobile" class="mw-redirect" title="Automobile">automobiles</a> and <a href="/wiki/Aircraft" title="Aircraft">aircraft</a>. The best examples were the <a href="/wiki/Wright_Brothers" class="mw-redirect" title="Wright Brothers">Wright Brothers</a>, who got their start as bicycle mechanics.r</p><p>The second major implication of the bicycle was the political organization of bicycle riders and enthusiasts in such groups as the League of American Wheelmen, in order to persuade local and state governments to create a system of well-maintained and mapped paved <a href="/wiki/Road" title="Road">roads</a>. Both the model of political organization and the roads themselves later facilitated the growth in the use of another type of wheeled vehicle, the automobile. r</p><p>What we really need is a picture:r</p><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Technical_aspect">Technical aspect</span></h2><p>And an article on <a href="/w/index.php?title=Bicycle_repair&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Bicycle repair (page does not exist)">bicycle repair and maintenance</a>.r</p><p>The picture should label the following parts:rframe, top tube, down tube, seat tube, seat post, headset (head set?), handlebars, front forks, rear forks, chain stay, rear stay, wheel, wheel rim, wheel axle, spoke, spoke flange, brakes, brake levers, saddle, bottom bracket, crankshaft, cranks, pedal, chain, chainring, rear gears.
